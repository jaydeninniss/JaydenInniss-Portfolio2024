                Providing an opportunity for youth filmmakers in Whistler was <span class="highlight">a way to give back to the community for everything it has provided to me. </span></p><p class="answer">In 2017, the World Ski and Snowboard Festival's Olympus 72-Hour Filmmaker Showdown chose my film as one of the top 10 films. It was screened in front of 1,600, which was mind-blowing when I was in grade 7. <span class="highlight">This event was full circle for me </span>as I was able to give filmmakers a similar opportunity to present their films and gain exposure within the community.<br><br>This whole event was so rewarding and I enjoyed every second of planning, developing and finally MCing the event alongside my incredibly talented peers: Sho Brooks and Kenta Tanaka.</p>
