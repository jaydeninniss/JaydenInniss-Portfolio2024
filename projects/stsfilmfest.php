                <h3 class="question" id="first">Overview</h3>
                <p class="answer">My two peers and I created a film festival designed for youth in Whistler to showcase their filmmaking talent. Sho Brooks, Kenta Tanaka and I led this initiative. The competition was designed as a fundraiser for our graduating class at Whistler Secondary School. After receiving 9 submitted films, we held a viewing night at our school for an audience of over 300. This event was a huge success: We exceeded our projected profit by $4,000, doubled our expected audience and gave a platform for young aspiring filmmakers to display their work in front of the community. <br><br>Our judging panel was composed of 5 local professional photographers/videographers. The Whistler community generously donated over $2,000 worth of prizes including a brand-new GoPro, which was awarded to the filmmakers and the audience in raffle draws. <br><br>The event would not have been a success without the help of Shauna Hardy and John Hall.</p>

                <h3 class="question">Conclusion</h3>
                <p class="answer">This event was a highlight of high school. Providing an opportunity for youth filmmakers in Whistler was a way to give back to the community for everything it has provided to me. In 2017, the World Ski and Snowboard Festival's Olympus 72-Hour Filmmaker Showdown chose my film as one of the top 10 films. It was screened in front of 1,600, which was mind-blowing when I was in grade 7. This event was full circle as I was able to give filmmakers a similar opportunity to present their films and gain exposure within the community.<br><br>This whole event was so rewarding and I enjoyed every second of planning, developing and finally MCing the event alongside my incredibly talented peers: Sho Brooks and Kenta Tanaka.</p>
