                <h3 class="question">Crankworx 2024 - TVA Utility</h3>
                <p class="answer">
                    When Crankworx came around again for Whistler in July 2024, I was approached to work with the broadcast team in a different role than the previous year. I was brought on as a TVA Utility which meant I was part of the setup and take-down crew. We were tasked with running over 100km of cable, first up a 3km 35Ëš plus course, followed by running cabling for 4 simultaneous bike events at the Whistler Mountain base. 
                </p>

                <p class="answer">
                    It was an incredibly physical week of hauling equipment into places they were not designed to be used in. It took four days to run cables up the mountain through the incredibly dense forest to reach remote camera positions. A total of 18 cameras lined the course for the downhill event in Creekside and another 22 at Whistler base. Throughout this hectic week, I learned so much about the inner workings of a television broadcast event and feel more comfortable working with the different departments within a broadcast truck! The entire experience was amazing and I am very grateful for how willing my colleagues were to take the time to teach me the ropes (and the cables).

                    In December 2023, the Luge World Cup came to The Whistler Sliding Centre. I was approached to work as a camera operator for the week of races.

                <p class="answer">
                    This was a full-circle opportunity for me, as I trained as a luge athlete for 9 years. I started sliding when I was 7 years old and competed in numerous national and international championships until I was 16 years old. Returning to the sliding center to film the championships was an incredible opportunity to give back to the sport that had given me so much!
                
                    My previous knowledge of the sport of Luge and this venue helped out within our broadcast team. This event was a perfect blend of both of my hobbies, which made it a ton of fun to work on!

                <h3 class="question">Crankworx 2023 - Camera Operator</h3>
                <p class="answer">
                    In June 2023, I was approached to work as a camera operator for Crankworx's television broadcast produced by Mesh Productions. I was over the moon to have an opportunity to work for Crankworx, as I grew up as a spectator of the yearly mountain bike event. 
                    
                    For the first weekend of events, I worked as a camera operator on the very first RockShox 1199 Downhill Race held in Creekside.

                    During the next 4 days of racing, I joined Crankworx's lead photographer, Clint Trahan, as his assistant. He broke his arm earlier in the season, so I carried his gear for him, but he also gave me the opportunity to second-shoot for him. I shot 6 events/races with him and it was mind-blowing to see into the process of such a talented photographer! I joined him on the final day of events, shooting the enduro on Top of the World. Those 5 long days taught me so much!

                    I joined the broadcast crew again for Red Bull Joyride! I worked alongside our presenters shooting the live show. I was the only camera for the live show, so it was very fast-paced! I was filming everything that was displayed on the jumbotrons placed throughout the village. For the hour before the event started and when the main livestream would go to a commercial break, the screens would switch to my camera for the in-person audience.
