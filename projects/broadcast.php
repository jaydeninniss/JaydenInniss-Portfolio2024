                <p class="answer">
                    In June 2023, I was approached to work as a camera operator for Crankworx's television broadcast produced by Mesh Productions. I was over the moon to have an opportunity to work for Crankworx, as I grew up as a spectator of the yearly mountain bike event. 
                    
                    For the first weekend of events, I worked as a camera operator on the very first RockShox 1199 Downhill Race held in Creekside.
                </p>

                <p class="answer">
                    During the next 4 days of racing, I joined Crankworx's lead photographer, Clint Trahan, as his assistant. He broke his arm earlier in the season, so I carried his gear for him, but he also gave me the opportunity to second-shoot for him. I shot 6 events/races with him and it was mind-blowing to see into the process of such a talented photographer! I joined him on the final day of events, shooting the enduro on Top of the World. Those 5 long days taught me so much! 
                </p>
                
                <p class="answer">
                    I joined the broadcast crew again for Red Bull Joyride! I worked alongside our presenters shooting the live show. I was the only camera for the live show, so it was very fast-paced! I was filming everything that was displayed on the jumbotrons placed throughout the village. For the hour before the event started and when the main livestream would go to a commercial break, the screens would switch to my camera for the in-person audience.
                </p>
                
                <p class="answer">
                    Overall, the week of events was amazing! I learned so much in such a short amount of time and I am so grateful to have the opportunity to see so many sides of this epic event!
                </p>
                
                <h3 class="question">FIL Luge World Championships 2023</h3>
                <p class="answer">
                    In December 2023, the Luge World Cup came to The Whistler Sliding Centre. I was approached to work as a camera operator for the week of races.
                </p>

                <p class="answer">
                    This was a full-circle opportunity for me, as I trained as a luge athlete for 9 years. I started sliding when I was 7 years old and competed in numerous national and international championships until I was 16 years old. Returning to the sliding center to film the championships was an incredible opportunity to give back to the sport that had given me so much!
                
                    My previous knowledge of the sport of Luge and this venue helped out within our broadcast team. This event was a perfect blend of both of my hobbies, which made it a ton of fun to work on!
