                <p class="answer">As a group, we chose to create a marketing campaign for a fictional outerwear company. <br><br>We had the idea of hosting an event to promote the release of a new jacket. The event would showcase the ski jacket in action during a free ski trip to Whistler for 30 raffle draw winners! <br><br>We began with defining our fictional outdoor apparel company Alpine Armour, and their new jacket, The Alta Jacket. We were excited with the idea of the jackets being created completely out of recycled materials giving every jacket a unique design. This gave us, as designers, a unique selling point and allowed us to use a wider variety of existing imagery for our promotional content.</p>
